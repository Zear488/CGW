```

3. Run the application:

## 📦 Packaging as .exe

Use PyInstaller to convert the app into an executable:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile ^
  --add-data "gachafiles;gachafiles" ^
  --add-data "original_gacha;original_gacha" ^
  --add-data "gacha_versions;gacha_versions" ^
  Gacha_app.py
```

> ⚠️ The `.txt` files in the `gachafiles/` folder are essential and must remain next to the `.exe` when distributing the app.
